# STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: [Project Name]

> **Phase 1 Deliverable** — This document must be 100% complete before writing any code.
> Use with the [7 Phase 1 Questions](../manifesto/Appendix_A_The_Toolkit.md#4-the-7-phase-1-questions) to validate completion.

---

## 1. THE CORE

* **Problem:** [Specific, painful, measurable problem]
* **User:** [Precise persona—e.g., "Solo SaaS Founders," not "Developers"]
* **Value Prop:** [One sentence: How you solve it differently]

**Implementation Implication:** [How this constrains technical decisions]

---

## 2. ECONOMIC ENGINE

* **Pricing Model:** [e.g., Freemium / Seat-based / Usage-based]
* **Unit Economics:** [Cost per user vs. Revenue per user]
* **Distribution:** [How you get your first 10 and first 100 users]

**Implementation Implication:** [How this affects architecture—e.g., "Client-side processing to minimize server costs"]

---

## 3. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

* **The "Big Decision":** [The one architectural choice that defines the system]
* **Stack Rationale:** [Why these tools specifically?]
* **Data Model:** [Core entities and their relationships]

**Implementation Implication:** [Specific technical constraints this creates]

---

## 4. EXECUTION SCOPE

* **MVP Must-Haves:** [3-5 features only]
  1. [Feature 1]
  2. [Feature 2]
  3. [Feature 3]

* **Explicitly Deferred:** [What you are NOT building yet—and why]
  - [Deferred item 1]: [Rationale]
  - [Deferred item 2]: [Rationale]

* **Risks:** [Top 3 risks and mitigation strategies]
  1. [Risk]: [Mitigation]
  2. [Risk]: [Mitigation]
  3. [Risk]: [Mitigation]

**Implementation Implication:** [What this means for Phase 2 specifications]
