name: stream-coding
description: Documentation-first development methodology. The goal is AI-ready documentation - when docs are clear enough, code generation becomes automatic. Triggers on "Build", "Create", "Implement", "Document", or "Spec out". Version 3.5 adds Phase 2.5 Adversarial Review and renames internal verification to Spec Gate (structural completeness). Clarity Gate is now a separate standalone tool for epistemic quality.

# Stream Coding v3.5: Documentation-First Development

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REFRAME: THIS IS A DOCUMENTATION METHODOLOGY, NOT A CODING METHODOLOGY

**The Goal:** AI-ready documentation. When documentation is clear enough, code generation becomes automatic.

**The Insight:**
> "If your docs are good enough, AI writes the code. The hard work IS the documentation. Code is just the printout."

**v3.5 Core Additions:**
1. Phase 2.5 Adversarial Review — stress-test specs with a hostile critic before execution. New time allocation: 40/40/5/10/5.
2. Renamed internal 13-item checklist to **Spec Gate** (structural completeness for code generation)

> **Two-gate pipeline — know the difference:**
> - **Spec Gate** (13 items, this skill) → *"Can AI execute this without asking questions?"*
> - **Clarity Gate** (9 points, separate tool) → *"Will AI mistake assumptions for facts?"*
>
> Spec Gate → Clarity Gate → Adversarial Review → Verified Specification → Execution

## CHANGELOG

| Version | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| 3.0 | Initial Stream Coding methodology |
| 3.1 | Clearer terminology, mandatory Spec Gate |
| 3.3 | Document-type-aware placement (Anti-patterns, Test Cases, Error Handling in implementation docs) |
| 3.3.1 | Corrected time allocation (40/40/20), added Phase 4, added Rule of Divergence |
| 3.4 | Complete 13-item Spec Gate, scoring rubric with weights, self-assessment questions, 4 mandatory section templates, Documentation Audit integrated into Phase 1 |
| **3.5** | **Phase 2.5 Adversarial Review added. New time allocation: 40/40/5/10/5. Internal 13-item checklist renamed from "Clarity Gate" → "Spec Gate". Two-gate pipeline documented: Spec Gate (structural) + Clarity Gate standalone (epistemic).** |

## THE STREAM CODING TRUTH

```
Messy Docs → Vague Specs → AI Guesses → Rework Cycles → 2-3x Velocity
Clear Docs → Clear Specs → AI Executes → Minimal Rework → 10-20x Velocity
```

**Why Most "AI-Assisted Development" Fails:**
- People feed AI messy docs
- AI generates code based on assumptions
- Code doesn't match intent
- Endless revision cycles
- Result: Marginally faster than manual coding

**Why Stream Coding Achieves 10-20x:**
- Documentation is clarified FIRST
- AI has zero ambiguity
- Code matches intent on first pass
- Minimal revision
- Result: Documentation time + automatic code generation

---

## DOCUMENT TYPE ARCHITECTURE

**The Rule:** Not all documents need all sections. Putting implementation details in strategic documents violates single-source-of-truth.

> "If AI has to decide where to find information, you've already lost velocity."

### Document Types

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Strategic** | WHAT and WHY | Master Blueprint, PRD, Vision docs, Business cases |
| **Implementation** | HOW | Technical Specs, API docs, Module specs, Architecture docs |
| **Reference** | Lookup | Schema Reference, Glossary, Configuration |

### Section Placement Matrix

| Section | Strategic Docs | Implementation Docs | Reference Docs |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Deep Links (References)** | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |
| **Anti-patterns** | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required | ❌ N/A |
| **Test Case Specifications** | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required | ❌ N/A |
| **Error Handling Matrix** | ❌ Pointer only | ✅ Required | ❌ N/A |

### Why This Matters

**Wrong (violates single-source-of-truth):**
```
Master Blueprint
├── Strategy content
├── Anti-patterns ← WRONG: duplicates Technical Spec
├── Test Cases ← WRONG: duplicates Testing doc
└── Error Matrix ← WRONG: duplicates Error Handling doc
```

**Right (single-source-of-truth):**
```
Master Blueprint (Strategic)
├── Strategy content
└── References
    └── Pointer: "Anti-patterns → Technical Spec, Section 7"

Technical Spec (Implementation)
├── Implementation details
├── Anti-patterns ← CORRECT: lives here
├── Test Cases ← CORRECT: lives here
└── Error Matrix ← CORRECT: lives here
```

---

## THE 4-PHASE METHODOLOGY

### Time Allocation

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Phase 1: Strategic Thinking | 40% | WHAT to build, WHY it matters |
| Phase 2: AI-Ready Documentation | 40% | HOW to build (specs so clear AI has zero decisions) |
| **Phase 2.5: Adversarial Review** | **5%** | **Stress-test specs with a hostile critic before execution** |
| Phase 3: Execution | 10% | Code generation + implementation |
| Phase 4: Quality & Iteration | 5% | Testing, refinement, divergence prevention |

**The logic:** Spending 5% upfront to break specs saves more than 5% in Phase 3 rework. If you bulletproof docs adversarially, execution gets faster — not slower.

---

## PHASE 2.5: ADVERSARIAL REVIEW (5% of time)

### When to Run

After Spec Gate passes (9+/10). Before any code generation.

**The principle:** The same AI that wrote your specs has the same blind spots you do. A different model — or a human with instructions to attack — finds what you can't see.

> "When code fails, fix the spec — not the code. Phase 2.5 finds spec failures before there's any code to fail."

### The Process

```
1. Spec Gate passes (9+/10) → proceed to adversarial step
2. Submit specs to DIFFERENT AI model (Gemini, GPT-4, Perplexity)
   OR trusted human reviewer
3. Use the adversarial prompt below
4. Categorize findings: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
5. Fix ALL CRITICAL issues → return to Spec Gate → re-score
6. Document HIGH issues with explicit accept/defer decision
7. Gate: zero CRITICAL remaining → proceed to Phase 3
```

**Why a different model:** The AI that generated or reviewed your docs learned your assumptions. A different model has no context, no charitable interpretation, no benefit of the doubt. It finds gaps your primary AI normalizes.

### The Adversarial Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a skeptical senior developer and hostile critic reviewing 
this specification before it goes to an AI agent for execution.

## Your Mission
Find every flaw. Assume problems exist — your job is to find them.
Do not be helpful. Do not suggest minor improvements. Attack the spec.

## What to Look For

### 1. LOGICAL CONTRADICTIONS
- Claims that conflict with each other within the spec
- Numbers that don't add up
- Requirements that are mutually exclusive

### 2. CREDIBILITY RISKS  
- Overclaims ("zero bugs", "always", "never", "guaranteed")
- Unverifiable statements with no measurement method
- Claims a hostile reader would immediately challenge

### 3. IMPLICIT DEGREES OF FREEDOM
- Points where the AI agent must CHOOSE between valid interpretations
- Anything where two different developers would implement differently
- Edge cases that are mentioned but not fully specified

### 4. MISSING CONSIDERATIONS
- Error states that have no specified handling
- Concurrency or race conditions not addressed  
- External dependencies with no fallback specified
- Security assumptions not made explicit

### 5. DEFENSIBILITY GAPS
- "What would a hostile HN commenter use to debunk this?"
- "What would a junior developer get wrong from this spec?"
- "What happens when the happy path fails?"

## Output Format

For each issue found:
**[SEVERITY]** — Issue title  
Location: Where in the spec  
Problem: What exactly is wrong  
Fix: Specific rewrite needed  

Severity:
- **CRITICAL:** Execution will fail or produce wrong output without this fix
- **HIGH:** Significant risk of incorrect implementation  
- **MEDIUM:** Minor ambiguity, lower risk
- **LOW:** Polish, not blocking

## Success Criteria

A good adversarial review finds:
- At least 2 CRITICAL issues (if zero, you haven't looked hard enough)
- At least 4-5 HIGH issues
- 10+ total issues across all severities

If you find fewer, state explicitly why the spec is unusually strong.
```

### Gate Criteria

- [ ] Zero CRITICAL issues remaining
- [ ] All HIGH issues documented with explicit decision: fix now / accept risk / defer
- [ ] Spec Gate re-run if any CRITICAL was fixed (score may have changed)

### What Counts as "Different AI"

**Rule: always use a different provider than your primary workflow. Same provider = confirmation bias.**

**This step is intentionally manual** — paste specs into a different chat and apply the adversarial prompt. No API key or integration required.

| Option | Access | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| GPT-5.2 / GPT-5.3 (ChatGPT) | Chat — no API key needed | Strong general reasoning; GPT-5.3-Codex excellent for code-spec gaps |
| Gemini 3 Pro / 3.1 (AI Studio) | Chat — no API key needed | 1M context; good at logical contradictions across long specs |
| GitHub Copilot (IDE chat) | In-editor | Convenient; GPT-5.x based; no context switch needed |
| o3 / o4-mini (ChatGPT) | Chat or API | Best for finding logical holes and edge cases |
| Perplexity | Chat | Useful for factual/credibility checks |
| Trusted human (senior dev) | — | Highest signal, highest effort |

**Never use the same Claude session** that helped write the docs. Start a fresh session at minimum — different model preferred.

## PHASE 1: STRATEGIC THINKING (40% of time)

### Decision Tree: Where Do You Start?

```
Phase 1: Strategic Product Thinking
│
├─ Have existing documentation?
│   └─ YES → Start with Documentation Audit → then 7 Questions
│
└─ Starting fresh?
    └─ Skip to 7 Questions
```

### Documentation Audit (Conditional)

**Skip this step if starting from scratch.** The Documentation Audit only applies when you have existing documentation—previous specs, inherited docs, or accumulated notes.

**Why clean existing docs?** Because most documentation accumulates cruft:
- Aspirational statements ("We will revolutionize...")
- Speculative futures ("In 2030, we might...")
- Outdated decisions (v1 architecture in v3 docs)
- Duplicate information across files
- Motivational fluff with no implementation value

**The Audit Process:**

Apply the Clarity Test to all existing documentation:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Actionable** | Can AI act on this? If aspirational, delete it. |
| **Current** | Is this still the decision? If changed, update or remove. |
| **Single Source** | Is this said elsewhere? Consolidate to one place. |
| **Decision** | Is this decided? If not, don't include it. |
| **Prompt-Ready** | Would you put this in an AI prompt? If not, delete. |

**Audit Checklist:**
- [ ] Remove all "vision" and "future state" language
- [ ] Delete motivational conclusions and preambles
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate information to single source
- [ ] Update all outdated architectural decisions
- [ ] Remove speculative features not in current scope

**Target:** 40-50% reduction in volume without losing actionable information.

Once clean, proceed to the 7 Questions.

---

### The 7 Questions Framework

Before ANY new documentation, answer these with specificity. Vague answers = vague code.

| # | Question | ❌ Reject | ✅ Require |
|---|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | What exact problem are you solving? | "Help users manage tasks" | "Help [specific persona] achieve [measurable outcome] in [specific context]" |
| 2 | What are your success metrics? | "Users save time" | Numbers + timeline: "100 users, 25% conversion, 3 months" |
| 3 | Why will you win? | "Better UI and features" | Structural advantage: architecture, data moat, business model |
| 4 | What's the core architecture decision? | "Let AI decide" | Human decides based on explicit trade-off analysis |
| 5 | What's the tech stack rationale? | "Node.js because I like it" | Business rationale: "Node—team expertise, ship fast" |
| 6 | What are the MVP features? | 10+ "must-have" features | 3-5 truly essential, rest explicitly deferred |
| 7 | What are you NOT building? | "We'll see what users want" | Explicit exclusions with rationale |

### Phase 1 Exit Criteria

- [ ] All 7 questions answered at "Require" level
- [ ] Strategic Blueprint document created
- [ ] Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major choices
- [ ] Zero ambiguity about WHAT you're building

## PHASE 2: AI-READY DOCUMENTATION (40% of time)

### The 4 Mandatory Sections (Implementation Docs)

Every implementation document MUST include these four sections. Without them, AI guesses—and guessing creates the velocity mirage.

#### 1. Anti-Patterns Section

**Why:** AI needs to know what NOT to do.

```markdown
## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do Instead | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Store timestamps as Date objects | Use ISO 8601 strings | Serialization issues |
| Hardcode configuration values | Use environment variables | Deployment flexibility |
| Use generic error messages | Specific error codes per failure | Debugging impossible otherwise |
| Skip validation on internal calls | Validate everything | Internal calls can have bugs too |
| Expose internal IDs in APIs | Use UUIDs or slugs | Security and flexibility |
```

**Rules:** Minimum 5 anti-patterns per implementation document.

#### 2. Test Case Specifications

**Why:** AI needs concrete verification criteria.

```markdown
## Test Case Specifications

### Unit Tests Required
| Test ID | Component | Input | Expected Output | Edge Cases |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| TC-001 | Tier classifier | 100 contacts | 20-30 in Critical tier | Empty list, all same score |
| TC-002 | Score calculator | Activity array | Score 0-100 | No events, >1000 events |

### Integration Tests Required
| Test ID | Flow | Setup | Verification | Teardown |
|---------|------|-------|--------------|----------|
| IT-001 | Auth flow | Create test user | Token refresh works | Delete test user |
```

**Rules:** Minimum 5 unit tests, 3 integration tests per component.

#### 3. Error Handling Matrix

**Why:** AI needs to know how to handle every failure mode.

```markdown
## Error Handling Matrix

### External Service Errors
| Error Type | Detection | Response | Fallback | Logging | Alert |
|------------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| API timeout | >5s response | Retry 3x exponential | Return cached | ERROR | If 3 in 5 min |
| Rate limit | 429 response | Pause 15 min | Queue for retry | WARN | If >5/hour |

### User-Facing Errors
| Error Type | User Message | Code | Recovery Action |
|------------|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Quota exceeded | "You've used all checks this month." | 403 | Show upgrade CTA |
| Session expired | "Please sign in again." | 401 | Redirect to login |
```

**Rules:** Every external service and user-facing error must be specified.

#### 4. Deep Links (All Document Types)

**Why:** AI needs to navigate to exact locations. "See Technical Annexes" is useless.

```markdown
## References

### Schema References
| Topic | Location | Anchor |
|-------|----------|--------|
| User profiles | [Schema Reference](../schemas/schema.md#user_profiles) | `user_profiles` |
| Events table | [Schema Reference](../schemas/schema.md#events) | `events` |

### Implementation References
| Topic | Document | Section |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Auth flow | [API Spec](../specs/api.md#authentication) | Section 3.2 |
| Rate limiting | [API Spec](../specs/api.md#rate-limiting) | Section 5 |
```

**Rules:** NEVER use vague references. ALWAYS include document path + section anchor.

---

## ⚠️ THE SPEC GATE (v3.5 - COMPLETE)

**⛔ NEVER SKIP THIS GATE.**

This is the difference between stream coding and vibe coding. A 7/10 spec generates 7/10 code that needs 30% rework.

### The 13-Item Spec Gate Checklist

Before ANY code generation, verify ALL items pass:

#### Foundation Checks (7 items)

| # | Check | Question |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Actionable** | Can AI act on every section? (No aspirational content) |
| 2 | **Current** | Is everything up-to-date? (No outdated decisions) |
| 3 | **Single Source** | No duplicate information across docs? |
| 4 | **Decision, Not Wish** | Every statement is a decision, not a hope? |
| 5 | **Prompt-Ready** | Would you put every section in an AI prompt? |
| 6 | **No Future State** | All "will eventually," "might," "ideally" language removed? |
| 7 | **No Fluff** | All motivational/aspirational content removed? |

#### Document Architecture Checks (6 items - v3.3 Critical)

| # | Check | Question |
|---|-------|----------|
| 8 | **Type Identified** | Document type clearly marked? (Strategic vs Implementation vs Reference) |
| 9 | **Anti-patterns Placed** | Anti-patterns in implementation docs only? (Strategic docs have pointers) |
| 10 | **Test Cases Placed** | Test cases in implementation docs only? (Strategic docs have pointers) |
| 11 | **Error Handling Placed** | Error handling matrix in implementation docs only? |
| 12 | **Deep Links Present** | Deep links in ALL documents? (No vague "see elsewhere") |
| 13 | **No Duplicates** | Strategic docs use pointers, not duplicate content? |

### Gate Enforcement

```
- [ ] All 7 Foundation Checks pass
- [ ] All 6 Document Architecture Checks pass
- [ ] AI Coder Understandability Score ≥ 9/10

If ANY item fails → Fix before proceeding to Phase 3
```

---

## AI CODER UNDERSTANDABILITY SCORING

Use this rubric to score documentation. Target: 9+/10 before Phase 3.

### The 6-Criterion Rubric

| Criterion | Weight | 10/10 Requirement |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Actionability** | 25% | Every section has Implementation Implication |
| **Specificity** | 20% | All numbers concrete, all thresholds explicit |
| **Consistency** | 15% | Single source of truth, no duplicates across docs |
| **Structure** | 15% | Tables over prose, clear hierarchy, predictable format |
| **Disambiguation** | 15% | Anti-patterns present (5+ per impl doc), edge cases explicit |
| **Reference Clarity** | 10% | Deep links only, no vague references |

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 10/10 | AI can implement with zero clarifying questions | Proceed to Phase 3 |
| 9/10 | 1 minor clarification needed | Fix, then proceed |
| 7-8/10 | 3-5 ambiguities exist | Major revision required |
| <7/10 | Not AI-ready, fundamental issues | Return to Phase 2 |

### Self-Assessment Questions

Before Phase 3, ask yourself:

1. **Actionability:** "Does every section tell AI exactly what to do?"
2. **Specificity:** "Are there any numbers I left vague?"
3. **Consistency:** "Is any information stated in more than one place?"
4. **Structure:** "Could I convert any prose paragraphs to tables?"
5. **Disambiguation:** "Have I listed at least 5 anti-patterns per implementation doc?"
6. **Reference Clarity:** "Do any references say 'see elsewhere' without exact location?"

If you answer "no" or "yes" to any question that should be opposite → Fix before proceeding.

---

## AI-ASSISTED SPEC GATE (Meta-Prompt)

Use this prompt to have Claude score your documentation:

```markdown
**ROLE:** You are the Spec Gatekeeper. Your job is to ruthlessly 
evaluate software specifications for ambiguity, incompleteness, and 
"vibe coding" tendencies.

**INPUT:** I will provide a technical specification document.

**TASK:** Grade this document on a scale of 1-10 using this rubric:

**RUBRIC:**
1. **Actionability (25%):** Does every section dictate a specific 
   implementation detail? (Reject aspirational like "fast" or 
   "scalable" without metrics)
2. **Specificity (20%):** Are data types, error codes, thresholds, 
   and edge cases explicitly defined? (Reject "handle errors appropriately")
3. **Consistency (15%):** Single source of truth? No duplicates?
4. **Structure (15%):** Tables over prose? Clear hierarchy?
5. **Disambiguation (15%):** Anti-patterns present? Edge cases explicit?
6. **Reference Clarity (10%):** Deep links only? No vague references?

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
1. **Score:** [X]/10
2. **Criterion Breakdown:** Score each of the 6 criteria
3. **Hallucination Risks:** List specific lines where an AI developer 
   would have to guess or make an assumption
4. **The Fix:** Rewrite the 3 most ambiguous sections into AI-ready specs

**THRESHOLD:** 
- 9-10: Ready for code generation
- 7-8: Needs revision before proceeding
- <7: Return to Phase 2
```

---

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION (10% of time)

### The Generate-Verify-Integrate Loop

```
1. GENERATE: Feed spec to AI → Receive code
2. VERIFY: Run tests → Check against spec
   - Does output match spec exactly?
   - Yes → Continue
   - No → Fix SPEC first, then regenerate
3. INTEGRATE: Commit → Update documentation if needed
```

### The Golden Rule of Phase 3

> **"When code fails, fix the spec—not the code."**

If generated code doesn't work:
1. ❌ Don't patch the code manually
2. ✅ Ask: "What was unclear in my spec?"
3. ✅ Fix the spec
4. ✅ Regenerate

**Why:** Manual code patches create divergence between spec and reality. Divergence compounds. Eventually your spec is fiction and you're back to manual development.

---

## PHASE 4: QUALITY & ITERATION (5% of time)

### The Rule of Divergence

> **Every time you manually edit AI-generated code without updating the spec, you create Divergence. Divergence is technical debt.**

**Why Divergence is Dangerous:**
- If you fix a bug in code but not spec, you can never regenerate that module
- Future AI iterations will reintroduce the bug
- You've broken the stream

### Preventing Divergence

| Scenario | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Bug in generated code | Fix code manually | Fix spec, regenerate |
| Missing edge case | Add code patch | Add to spec, regenerate |
| Performance issue | Optimize code | Document constraint, regenerate |
| "Quick fix" needed | "Just this once..." | No. Fix spec. |

### The "Day 2" Workflow

1. **Isolate the Module:** Target the specific module, not the whole app
2. **Update the Spec:** Add the new edge case, requirement, or fix
3. **Regenerate the Module:** Feed updated spec to AI
4. **Verify Integration:** Run test suite for regressions

This takes 5 minutes longer than a quick hotfix. But it ensures your documentation never drifts from reality.

## TRIGGER BEHAVIOR

This methodology activates when the user says:
- "Build [feature]" → Full methodology (Phases 1-4)
- "Create [component]" → Full methodology
- "Implement [system]" → Check: Do clear docs exist?
- "Document [project]" → Phases 1-2 only
- "Spec out [feature]" → Phases 1-2 only
- "Clean up docs for [X]" → Documentation Audit only

### Response Protocol

1. **Check for existing docs:** "Do you have existing documentation for this project?"
2. **If existing docs:** "Let's start with a Documentation Audit to clean them before building."
3. **If Phase 1 incomplete:** "Before building, let's clarify strategy. [Ask 7 Questions]"
4. **If Phase 2 incomplete:** "Before coding, let's ensure documentation is AI-ready. [Run Spec Gate]"
5. **If Spec Gate not passed:** "Documentation scores [X]/10. Let's fix [specific issues] before proceeding."
6. **If Phase 3 ready:** "Documentation passes Spec Gate (9+/10). Generating implementation..."
7. **If maintaining (Phase 4):** "Is this change spec-conformant? Let's update docs first."

---

## THE STREAM CODING CONTRACT

### YOU MUST:

**Documentation Audit (if existing docs):**
- [ ] Run Clarity Test on all existing documentation
- [ ] Remove aspirational/future state language
- [ ] Consolidate duplicates to single source
- [ ] Target 40-50% reduction without losing actionable content

**Phase 1:**

**Phase 2:**
- [ ] Identify document type (Strategic vs Implementation vs Reference)
- [ ] Add 4 mandatory sections to each implementation doc
- [ ] Add deep links to ALL documents
- [ ] Use pointers (not duplicates) in strategic docs

**Phase 2.5 — Adversarial Review:**
- [ ] Submit specs to different AI model or human reviewer
- [ ] Use adversarial prompt template
- [ ] Fix ALL CRITICAL issues before Phase 3
- [ ] Document HIGH issues with accept/defer decision
- [ ] Re-run Spec Gate if CRITICAL issues were fixed

**Spec Gate:**
- [ ] Pass all 13 checklist items

### YOU CANNOT:

- ❌ Build on existing docs without running Documentation Audit first
- ❌ Skip to coding without clear docs
- ❌ Accept vague specs ("handle errors appropriately")
- ❌ Skip Spec Gate (even if you wrote the docs yourself)
- ❌ Put Anti-patterns/Test Cases/Error Handling in strategic docs
- ❌ Use vague references ("see Technical Annexes")
- ❌ Duplicate content across document types
- ❌ Iterate on code when problem is in spec
- ❌ Edit code without updating spec (creates Divergence)

## QUICK REFERENCE

### The 13-Item Spec Gate

**Foundation (7):**
1. Actionable? 2. Current? 3. Single source? 4. Decision not wish?
5. Prompt-ready? 6. No future state? 7. No fluff?

**Architecture (6):**
8. Type identified? 9. Anti-patterns placed correctly? 10. Test cases placed correctly?
11. Error handling placed correctly? 12. Deep links present? 13. No duplicates?

### The Scoring Rubric

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Actionability | 25% |
| Specificity | 20% |
| Consistency | 15% |
| Structure | 15% |
| Disambiguation | 15% |
| Reference Clarity | 10% |

### Core Mantras

1. "Documentation IS the work. Code is just the printout."
2. "When code fails, fix the spec—not the code."
3. "A 7/10 spec generates 7/10 code that needs 30% rework."
4. "If AI has to decide where to find information, you've already lost velocity."

**Version:** 3.5
**Changes from 3.4:**
- Phase 2.5 Adversarial Review added (full section with process, prompt template, gate criteria)
- Time allocation updated: 40/40/5/10/5 (was 40/40/15/5)
- "Clarity Gate" renamed to "Spec Gate" throughout (structural completeness, 13 items)
- Two-gate pipeline documented: Spec Gate (this skill) + Clarity Gate (separate standalone tool for epistemic quality)
- Contract section updated with Phase 2.5 checklist
- Quick reference diagram updated
- Core insight: Spec Gate catches completeness. Adversarial Review catches correctness. Clarity Gate (standalone) catches epistemic drift.
